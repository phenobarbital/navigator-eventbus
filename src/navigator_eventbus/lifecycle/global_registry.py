"""Global registry singleton and scope() context manager.

FEAT-176 — Lifecycle Events System.

This module provides the process-wide singleton ``EventRegistry`` that
observes every lifecycle event unless an agent opts out via
``forward_to_global=False``.

The ``scope()`` context manager replaces the global registry with a fresh
one for the duration of the block, then restores the previous registry on
exit — even if the block raises. This is required for test isolation,
especially under pytest parallelism.

Storage uses a ``ContextVar`` so that each asyncio task sees a coherent
registry and nested ``scope()`` blocks operate independently via the
ContextVar token/reset pattern.

    Yields a new ``EventRegistry(forward_to_global=False)`` and restores the
    previous registry on exit, even if the block raises. Use this in tests
    and isolated execution contexts to prevent event leakage between scopes.

    The token-based restore via ``ContextVar.reset(token)`` is the only
    correct way to restore the prior value — direct re-assignment would break
    the ContextVar chain for nested scopes.

    Yields:
        A fresh, isolated ``EventRegistry`` instance.

    Warning:
        Tasks scheduled via ``create_task`` inside the scope may still hold a
        reference to the scoped registry after ``scope()`` exits.  In tests,
        always ``await asyncio.sleep(0)`` before asserting on events forwarded
        to the global registry to ensure all scheduled tasks have completed.

    Example::

        with scope() as reg:
            reg.subscribe(BeforeInvokeEvent, my_listener)
            await agent.ask("hello")
        # Subscriptions are gone after the block.
