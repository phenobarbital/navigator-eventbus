    """Emitted to the global registry when a subscriber raises.

    Part of the error isolation model (B): subscriber exceptions are caught,
    logged, and reported as SubscriberErrorEvents to the global registry
    instead of propagating to the caller.

    NEVER re-routed back to a subscriber that is itself failing (guarded
    by a recursion guard in EventRegistry to prevent infinite loops).

    Note:
        The ``traceback`` field is truncated to the last 20 lines in
        ``to_dict()`` to prevent accidental secret exposure in webhook
        payloads (e.g., environment variables printed in tracebacks).

    Attributes:
        failed_subscriber: String representation of the failing subscriber
            callback (``repr(callback)``).
        original_event_class: Class name of the event that triggered the
            failing subscriber.
        error_type: ``type(exc).__name__`` of the exception.
        error_message: String representation of the exception.
        traceback: Full traceback string from ``traceback.format_exc()``.
            Truncated to the last 20 lines in ``to_dict()`` output.

        may appear in long tracebacks when the event is forwarded to webhook
        payloads or external observability backends.
