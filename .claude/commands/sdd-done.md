# /sdd-done -- Verify, Push, and Cleanup a Feature

Verify that a feature's tasks were implemented in its worktree, ensure the branch is
pushed, and clean up the worktree.

**This command runs on the spec's `base_branch`** -- read from the spec's
YAML frontmatter (FEAT-145). For `type: feature` that is `dev` (default)
or `staging` (during a release freeze); for `type: hotfix` that is `main`.
NOT inside a worktree. It looks INTO the worktree to verify work, but
modifies state only on `base_branch`.

## Usage
```
/sdd-done FEAT-014
/sdd-done eventbus-dlq-support
/sdd-done FEAT-014 --dry-run           # show what would change, don't change anything
/sdd-done FEAT-014 --force             # mark done even if some checks fail
/sdd-done FEAT-014 --sync-down        # for hotfixes: after the user merges the PR
                                       # to main, propagate the change to staging + dev
                                       # (mostly redundant with sync-down.yml Action)
```

## Guardrails
- **Must run on the spec's `base_branch`** (read from spec frontmatter -- `dev` for features, `main` for hotfixes), not inside a worktree.
- Do NOT mark tasks as done unless evidence exists in the worktree (commits, files).
- Do NOT modify the spec -- only task statuses and task files.
- If a task has no evidence of implementation, flag it explicitly.
- Always show a verification report before making changes.

> **CRITICAL -- `/sdd-done` NEVER pushes to `main` and NEVER opens a PR against `main` (FEAT-145).**
> Hotfixes go to `main` ONLY via a manually-opened PR. This rule is non-negotiable
> and applies to every flag combination -- including `--force`.
> For hotfixes, this command pushes the hotfix branch and prints a `gh pr create
> --base main` snippet. After the user merges the PR, the `.github/workflows/sync-down.yml`
> Action propagates the change to `staging` and `dev` automatically. If the Action
> fails or you are offline, re-run with `--sync-down` to propagate the change back to
> both `staging` and `dev` manually.

## Steps

### 1. Verify We're on the Base Branch (FEAT-145)

Read the spec's frontmatter to discover `BASE_BRANCH`:

```bash
META=$(python -c "from pathlib import Path; from scripts.sdd.sdd_meta import parse; m = parse(Path('<spec-path>')); print(m.type, m.base_branch)")
TYPE=$(echo "$META" | awk '{print $1}')
BASE_BRANCH=$(echo "$META" | awk '{print $2}')
CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
```

If `CURRENT_BRANCH != BASE_BRANCH`, abort:
```
/sdd-done must run on the spec's base_branch (got <CURRENT_BRANCH>, expected <BASE_BRANCH>).
   Switch: git checkout <BASE_BRANCH>
```

If currently inside a worktree (path contains `.claude/worktrees/`), abort:
```
/sdd-done must run from the main repo, not inside a worktree.
   cd back to the main repo and re-run.
```

### 2. Resolve the Feature
1. Glob `sdd/tasks/index/*.json` (excluding `_orphans.json`) and find the
   per-spec index whose header matches the user's input. Match against:
   - `feature_id` -- exact match (e.g., `"FEAT-014"`)
   - `feature` -- exact match (e.g., `"eventbus-dlq-support"`)
   - `feature_id` -- numeric suffix (e.g., `"014"` -> `"FEAT-014"`)
   - `feature` -- substring match (e.g., `"eventbus"` -> `"eventbus-dlq-support"`)
   If no match, list available features (one per per-spec index file) and ask the user to clarify.
2. Read the spec file referenced by the per-spec index header.
3. The list of tasks for this feature is the `tasks[]` array in the matched per-spec index file.

### 3. Locate the Worktree
Find the feature's worktree:
```bash
git worktree list | grep "feat-<FEAT-ID>"
```
Extract the worktree path. If no worktree found:
```
No worktree found for FEAT-<ID>.
   Looking for branch feat-<FEAT-ID>-<slug> in remote...
```
Fall back to checking remote branches.

### 4. Gather Evidence from the Worktree
For each task in the feature, check the WORKTREE for implementation evidence:

**a) Git history check (in the worktree):**
```bash
git -C <worktree-path> log --oneline --grep="TASK-<NNN>"
git -C <worktree-path> log --oneline --grep="<task-slug>"
```

**b) File existence check (in the worktree):**
Read the task file and extract the "Files to create/modify" section.
```bash
test -f <worktree-path>/<filepath>
```

**c) Test check (optional, skip if --force):**
If the task file lists test commands, run them in the worktree:
```bash
cd <worktree-path> && pytest <test-path> -x -q 2>&1 | tail -5
```

### 5. Build Verification Report
Classify each task:

- **VERIFIED** -- commit found AND files exist AND tests pass (or no tests specified).
- **PARTIAL** -- commit found but some files missing or tests failing.
- **NO EVIDENCE** -- no matching commits, files don't exist.

Present the report:
```
Verification Report: FEAT-<ID> -- <title>

Worktree: .claude/worktrees/feat-<ID>-<slug>
Branch: feat-<ID>-<slug>
Commits found: <N>
Tasks: <total> total, <verified> verified, <partial> partial, <missing> missing

  VERIFIED: TASK-096 -- Event Bus Core
     Commits: feat(eventbus): TASK-096 -- Event Bus Core (abc1234)
     Files: src/navigator_eventbus/bus.py [ok]
     Tests: 3 passed [ok]

  PARTIAL: TASK-097 -- DLQ Handler
     Commits: feat(eventbus): TASK-097 -- DLQ Handler (def5678)
     Files: src/navigator_eventbus/dlq.py [ok]
     Tests: 1 failed [warning]

  NO EVIDENCE: TASK-098 -- Ingress Models
     Commits: none found
     Files: src/navigator_eventbus/ingress_models.py [missing]
```

### 6. Confirm
If all tasks are VERIFIED:
```
All tasks verified. Proceed with closing? (Y/n)
```

If any tasks are PARTIAL or NO EVIDENCE:
```
<N> task(s) have issues. Options:
  1. Close verified tasks only (mark others as "pending")
  2. Close all with --force (mark partial as "done-with-issues")
  3. Abort -- fix issues first
```

If `--dry-run`, show the report and STOP.
If `--force`, close all tasks regardless.

### 7. Close Tasks (on `<BASE_BRANCH>`)

For each task being closed, update the per-spec index in place. We are
already on `BASE_BRANCH` (verified in Step 1).

> **CRITICAL -- use the script, do NOT hand-roll the move.** See the note in
> `/sdd-start`: closing a task is a *move*, and agents that copy instead leave
> `active/` orphans that survive the merge. `scripts/sdd/close_task.sh` does the
> `git mv` + index stamp + a hard post-condition (exit 3 if an `active/` copy
> survives).

```bash
# Close each task being closed (idempotent; stamps the index header when the
# whole feature is done). Repeat per task id:
scripts/sdd/close_task.sh TASK-<NNN> <feature-slug> verified

# Update task file headers (Status/Completed/Verification) in the completed/ copy.

# Commit ONLY the staged SDD state -- never "git add ." / "git add -A".
git diff --cached --name-only      # sanity-check: only index + task files
git commit -m "sdd: close tasks for FEAT-<ID> -- <title>"
```

### 8. Push the Feature Branch
If the worktree branch hasn't been pushed yet:
```bash
git -C <worktree-path> push origin feat-<FEAT-ID>-<slug>
```

### 9. Merge Feature Branch into `<BASE_BRANCH>` (FEAT-145, flow-aware)

> **CRITICAL**: This is the step that brings the implementation code into the
> base branch. Without it, the task index is updated but the code changes remain
> only on the feature branch -- causing "marked done but not implemented" issues.

**Hard refusal -- `BASE_BRANCH == "main"`:**

```bash
if [[ "$BASE_BRANCH" == "main" ]]; then
    cat <<EOF
Hotfix merging into 'main' MUST go through a PR. /sdd-done refuses to merge
   into main directly, regardless of flags.

   Open the PR manually:

     gh pr create --base main --head feat-<FEAT-ID>-<slug> \
       --title "<hotfix title>" \
       --body "<verification summary>"

   After the PR merges, the sync-down.yml Action propagates the change to staging
   and dev automatically. If the Action fails or you are offline, re-run with
   --sync-down to propagate the change manually:

     /sdd-done <FEAT-ID> --sync-down

EOF
    exit 0   # NOT an error -- the hotfix workflow continues outside this command
fi
```

**Feature flow (`BASE_BRANCH != "main"`)** -- perform the merge:

```bash
# We're already on $BASE_BRANCH (verified in Step 1)
git merge --no-edit feat-<FEAT-ID>-<slug>
```

If the merge has conflicts:
```
Merge conflict when merging feat-<FEAT-ID>-<slug> into <BASE_BRANCH>.
   Conflicting files:
     - <file1>
     - <file2>

   Options:
     1. Resolve conflicts now (recommended)
     2. Abort merge: git merge --abort
```
If conflicts are resolved, commit the merge. If the user aborts, STOP and
do NOT proceed to cleanup.

**Self-heal -- reap stalled `active/` orphans (runs after every merge):**

> The merge can carry an `active/` copy of a task back onto `<BASE_BRANCH>` if
> the feature branch ever copied-instead-of-moved during completion. This sweep
> removes any `active/` file whose task is `done` in the index AND has a
> `completed/` twin (leaves others for manual review). It is idempotent and
> safe to run unconditionally.

```bash
scripts/sdd/heal_orphans.sh <feature-slug>
# If it reaped anything, commit the cleanup before pushing:
if ! git diff --cached --quiet -- sdd/tasks/active sdd/tasks/completed; then
  git commit -m "sdd: reap stalled active task orphans for FEAT-<ID> -- <title>"
fi
```

After a successful merge and self-heal, push `<BASE_BRANCH>`:
```bash
git push origin "$BASE_BRANCH"
```

### 9.5. Hotfix -> Sync-down (FEAT-187, only with `--sync-down`)

This sub-step runs ONLY when the user passes `--sync-down` AND `TYPE == "hotfix"`.
It propagates a hotfix that has just been merged into `main` (via the manual PR
from #9) back into `staging` and `dev` so both stay in sync.

In normal operation, `.github/workflows/sync-down.yml` does this automatically
after every push to `main`. Run this command only when the Action has failed or
the user is operating offline.

**Pre-flight (run once):** verify the hotfix landed on `origin/main`:
```bash
git fetch origin
if ! git merge-base --is-ancestor "feat-<FEAT-ID>-<slug>" origin/main; then
    echo "feat-<FEAT-ID>-<slug> is not yet an ancestor of origin/main."
    echo "   Open the PR and merge it first, then re-run with --sync-down."
    exit 1
fi
```

**Sync to `staging`** -- optimistic auto-merge with safe abort on conflict:
```bash
git checkout staging
git pull --ff-only origin staging

if git merge --no-edit feat-<FEAT-ID>-<slug>; then
    git push origin staging
    echo "staging synced with hotfix feat-<FEAT-ID>-<slug>."
    STAGING_OK=true
else
    git merge --abort
    STAGING_OK=false
    cat <<EOF
Conflict syncing hotfix into staging. The merge has been aborted (no changes left).

    Resolve manually:
      git checkout staging
      git merge feat-<FEAT-ID>-<slug>
      # ...resolve conflicts in your editor...
      git commit
      git push origin staging

EOF
fi
```

**Sync to `dev`** -- optimistic auto-merge with safe abort on conflict
(independent of `staging` outcome -- always attempt):
```bash
git checkout dev
git pull --ff-only origin dev

if git merge --no-edit feat-<FEAT-ID>-<slug>; then
    git push origin dev
    echo "dev synced with hotfix feat-<FEAT-ID>-<slug>."
    DEV_OK=true
else
    git merge --abort
    DEV_OK=false
    cat <<EOF
Conflict syncing hotfix into dev. The merge has been aborted (no changes left).

    Resolve manually:
      git checkout dev
      git merge feat-<FEAT-ID>-<slug>
      # ...resolve conflicts in your editor...
      git commit
      git push origin dev

EOF
fi
```

**Return to base:** leave the user on `main` (the hotfix's base branch):
```bash
git checkout main
```

**Summary and exit code:**
```bash
if $STAGING_OK && $DEV_OK; then
    echo "Sync-down complete: staging and dev are in sync with main."
    exit 0
else
    echo "Sync-down partially failed. See above for failed targets."
    exit 1
fi
```

### 10. Cleanup the Worktree
```bash
git worktree remove .claude/worktrees/feat-<FEAT-ID>-<slug>
```
If there are uncommitted changes in the worktree, warn:
```
Worktree has uncommitted changes. Force remove? (y/N)
```

If the worktree was already removed, prune stale metadata:
```bash
git worktree prune
```

Optionally delete the local feature branch (it's been merged):
```bash
git branch -d feat-<FEAT-ID>-<slug>
```

### 11. Output
```
FEAT-<ID> -- <title>: <N>/<total> tasks closed.

Closed:
  TASK-096 -- Event Bus Core (verified)
  TASK-097 -- DLQ Handler (verified)

Index updated on dev and committed.
Branch pushed: feat-<ID>-<slug>
Merged into dev: feat-<ID>-<slug> [ok]
Worktree removed: .claude/worktrees/feat-<ID>-<slug>
Local branch deleted: feat-<ID>-<slug>
```

If ALL tasks were closed:
```
FEAT-<ID> -- <title>: all <N> tasks closed and merged into dev.

Worktree cleaned up.
Feature branch merged and deleted.
```
